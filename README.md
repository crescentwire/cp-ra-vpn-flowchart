# cp-ra-vpn-flowchart
A visual decision guide for choosing the right Remote Access VPN option in Check Point deployments.

This repository contains the original editable version of a decision flowchart designed to help users choose the right Remote Access VPN option when working with Check Point solutions.

Originally created to assist with field conversations, it breaks down key decision points based on use case, topology, and licensing. It's now being shared with the broader community for ongoing use and improvement.

## Files

## Project Status

As of June 2025, I (Michael Ibarra) am no longer maintaining this project. I created this flowchart during my time at Check Point, but as I'm moving on from the company, I’m turning this resource over to the community.

If someone wants to step up as a maintainer, feel free to create your own version and continue development. Attribution is appreciated.
